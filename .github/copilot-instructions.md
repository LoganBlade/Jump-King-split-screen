Repo-specific tips for AI training (checkpoints, saving & importing brains):
- Toggle checkpoint progression: press `P` — when on, new generations will start from the highest recently-unlocked level instead of the game start.
- Carry actions are always enabled: brains continue from the captured parent's instruction number when resuming at a checkpoint.
- Reapply checkpoint instantly: press `K` — forces all current players to reapply the saved checkpoint state (useful while testing).
- Save to file: press `1` to download a `.json` brain file; drag it onto the canvas or double-click to import.
